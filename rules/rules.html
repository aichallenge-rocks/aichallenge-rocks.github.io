                A round-robin tournament means that each bot meets all other bots in turn. 
                Each pair of bots plays two games: each bot play first hand at one game and second hand at another.  
            </p><p>

                Once bot wins the game player gets score of 1. Lost bot gets score of 0. 
                In case of draw both bots get score of 0.5. 
                Once bot hangs or throws an error during the game then it evaluates as loss.
